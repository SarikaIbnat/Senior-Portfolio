        <td>CFU #3 Passing the Flythrough Scene: I struggled a lot with these because navigating on unity is challenging and then my keyboard started acting strange too like some of the keys weren't doing what they are supposed to. </td>

        <td>Chatbot- The directions on projectstem seemed pretty straight forward. I had to ask for 6 user inputs, use 3 elif statements and use the import math and random.randint() function. I got a 20/20 on this as well.</td>

        <td>Divisible by Three- This was a bit intricate, I had to fisrt ask the user how many values they want to check and based on what they input. I had to store that and write a function that checks whether a number is divisible by 3 and call the function that many times. I got a 20/20 on this think I had to debug a few times.</td>

        <td>Create a Storyboard- This is where we planned what our winter animation will look like step by step. I used 6 boxes showing gradual change where I decided to show a christmas tree outside in the snowfall, then its taken inside the home and decorated and presents come under the tree for christmas. I got 17/20 on this.</td>

        <td>Calendar- We had to ask users to pick a date and give 3 options- whether they want to know the number of days that passed in the year or the number of days in the given month. While it was complicated calculating the leap year and writing that function and I had to debug multiple times and try out a lot of differet ideas. In the end I got a 20/20.</td>

        <td>Winter Animation- Based on the storyboard we had to execute this onto an actual animation using simple gui-or graphical user interface on code skulptor. I'd say the most challenging part was just figuring out the coordinates to make the tree symmetrical and a bit about calling each function after the other so the animation makes sense. I'm proud of this work but I got a 8/10 meaning I can improve on it.</td>
