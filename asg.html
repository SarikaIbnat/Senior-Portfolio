        <td>Silly Sentences-We had to ask for user input to give a word each time store them in a variable and at the end fill in the paragrphs using those words. It was my first ever project on projectstem and I didn't know how to read the comments and debug. So I got a 13.4/20 but I leant a lot from it. </td>

        <td>Room Area- I remeber I had to apply geometry knowledge to solve this. We had an irregualar shaped room using 3 shapes and I drew it out to figure out how to calculate the overall area of the room based on the values of width and height provided. It was quite tricky but solving it on paper first helped me and I got a 20/20 on this. </td>

        <td>Chatbot- The directions on projectstem seemed pretty straight forward. I had to ask for 6 user inputs, use 3 elif statements and use the import math and random.randint() function. I got a 20/20 on this as well.</td>

        <td>Divisible by Three- This was a bit intricate, I had to fisrt ask the user how many values they want to check and based on what they input. I had to store that and write a function that checks whether a number is divisible by 3 and call the function that many times. I got a 20/20 on this think I had to debug a few times.</td>

        <td>Create a Storyboard- This is where we planned what our winter animation will look like step by step. I used 6 boxes showing gradual change where I decided to show a christmas tree outside in the snowfall, then its taken inside the home and decorated and presents come under the tree for christmas. I got 17/20 on this.</td>

        <td>Calendar- We had to ask users to pick a date and give 3 options- whether they want to know the number of days that passed in the year or the number of days in the given month. While it was complicated calculating the leap year and writing that function and I had to debug multiple times and try out a lot of differet ideas. In the end I got a 20/20.</td>

        <td>Winter Animation- Based on the storyboard we had to execute this onto an actual animation using simple gui-or graphical user interface on code skulptor. I'd say the most challenging part was just figuring out the coordinates to make the tree symmetrical and a bit about calling each function after the other so the animation makes sense. I'm proud of this work but I got a 8/10 meaning I can improve on it.</td>

        <td>Personal Organizer- We basically had to ask some questions to the user like entering an event. When is that event and writing functions and printing out an organized schedule or to do list for them. This felt challenging as I had to write a bunch of functions to organize my code. I did not do well on this assignment got a 6/20.</td>

        <td>Peaceformers Challenge- I picked Inequity and how to help with that. So, my game would encourage people to waste less water and food and donate food o food drives and to those who need it but cannot afford it. The task was to retrieve water and then there would be ahint and based off that you'd have to decide which person actually needs the water and give it to them and not the imposter. I rushed on this assignment so it wasn't the best work. I got 75/100.</td>

        <td>Rocket Ships Lab- Our first animation launching a rocket by going on the figma prototype where we created 3 frames and connected the noodles and chose which frame comes after another. So it looks like we launched a rocket. Was not the best work but class time ran out and had to figure it bu myself. Git 7/10</td>
