      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Hi! I am Sarika Ibnat and here's everything you need to know about me. I like watching law shows or anything with a good plot, I like drawing or painting characters or room decors, playing badminton or just exploring NYC. I also like contributing to the society by volunteering or through my Natural Areas Conservancy summer internship which educated me about the forest park ecosystem while cleaning and conserving the nature. I'm really glad to get the opportunity to learn python language and participate in different competitions as a group or alone. So, I'm here to reflect on how far I've come along this year. I felt it was overall a good year but could have ended the year off stronger but I've grown a lot, improving on my skills and persevering. </p>
