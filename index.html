      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>Hi! I am Sarika Ibnat and here's everything you need to know about me since the end of junior year. I have worked on a summer research project on the correlation between the crown vigor of overstory trees and lichens. I've learned to ID plants at Forest Park. Currently, a senior in the process of applying to colleges, figuring out my career path, and just finding myself. I'm so grateful for choosing Web/App Development shop class at TAEHS even though that's not my intended major because it has taught me multiple lessons: patience, problem-solving, & collaboration. These are skills that I believe I couldn't have learned in any other shop class which will be valuable to me in the future as I could navigate through the challenging moments of my life with patience and try to figure out solutions to the problems life throws at me, as well as be a team player in the future. I'm not particularly a fan of learning to build open-world games on Unity but I think I can handle it. </p>
